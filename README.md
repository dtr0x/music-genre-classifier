Softmax classifier trained using a feedforward neural network with stochastic gradient descent, written in R. Initially tested on a music data set from the Discogs database to classify genre. Recording features were created using Essentia. The main script performs principal component analysis on the data to train. Can be adapted for multiclass classification problems with a high-dimensional feature set.
